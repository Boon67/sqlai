## üîß Configuration

### snowflake.yml
```yaml
definition_version: 2
entities:
  CORTEX_AISQL_DEMO.DEMO_DATA.cortex_aisql_demo:
    type: streamlit
    title: "Cortex AISQL Functions Demo"
    query_warehouse: COMPUTE_WH
    main_file: streamlit_app.py
    stage: CORTEX_AISQL_DEMO.DEMO_DATA.streamlit_stage
    artifacts:
      - streamlit_app.py
      - environment.yml
      - setup_data.sql
```

### Key Features in Code

**Fully Qualified Names:**
All queries use fully qualified table names to avoid context issues:
```python
FROM CORTEX_AISQL_DEMO.DEMO_DATA.customer_tickets
```

**Structured Outputs:**
AI_EXTRACT uses structured key-value format:
```python
AI_EXTRACT(text, [['key', 'question']]):response.key::string
```

**JSON Parsing:**
AI_CLASSIFY and AI_SENTIMENT return JSON that must be parsed:
```python
AI_CLASSIFY(text, categories):labels[0]::string
AI_SENTIMENT(text):categories[0].sentiment::string
```

**PROMPT Function:**
AI_FILTER requires the PROMPT() function:
```python
AI_FILTER(PROMPT('question {0}', text_column))
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Database not found

**Solution:**
```bash
snow sql -f setup_data.sql
```

### Permission denied on Cortex functions

**Solution:**
```sql
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN;
GRANT DATABASE ROLE SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX_USER TO ROLE <your_role>;
```

### AI_EXTRACT argument type error

**Correct format:**
```sql
AI_EXTRACT(
    text_column,
    [['key_name', 'question']]
):response.key_name::string
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå `AI_EXTRACT(prompt, text)` - Wrong argument order
- ‚úÖ `AI_EXTRACT(text, [['key', 'question']])` - Correct

### AI_AGG with GROUP BY error

AI_AGG cannot be used with GROUP BY. Use separate queries with WHERE clauses:

```sql
-- ‚ùå INCORRECT - Will fail
SELECT category, AI_AGG(text, 'prompt') FROM table GROUP BY category;

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use separate queries
SELECT AI_AGG(text, 'prompt') FROM table WHERE category = 'Claims';
```

### AI_CLASSIFY returns JSON

Parse the JSON output to get the label:

```sql
-- ‚ùå Returns: {"labels": ["cyber_insurance"]}
AI_CLASSIFY(text, ['cyber_insurance', 'directors_officers'])

-- ‚úÖ Returns: cyber_insurance
AI_CLASSIFY(text, ['cyber_insurance', 'directors_officers']):labels[0]::string
```

### AI_FILTER argument error

Use the PROMPT() function:

```sql
-- ‚ùå INCORRECT
AI_FILTER(text_column, 'question')

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT
AI_FILTER(PROMPT('question {0}', text_column))
```

### Streamlit deployment fails

**Check connection and warehouse:**
```bash
snow connection test
snow sql -q "SELECT CURRENT_WAREHOUSE()"
```

**Resume warehouse if suspended:**
```sql
ALTER WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH RESUME IF SUSPENDED;
```

### Import errors in Streamlit

**Redeploy with replace flag:**
```bash
snow streamlit deploy --replace
```

## üí° Customization

### Adding Your Own Insurance Data

1. Modify `setup_data.sql` to include your data:
```sql
INSERT INTO customer_tickets VALUES
(19, 'Your Company', 'your.email@company.com', 'Ticket text...', '2024-02-15', 'Claims');
```

2. Redeploy:
```bash
snow sql -f setup_data.sql
snow streamlit deploy --replace
```

### Customizing the Claims Dashboard

The Claims Analytics Dashboard can be customized by modifying `streamlit_app.py`:

1. **Add new metrics**: Update the Key Metrics section
2. **Change insurance type filters**: Modify the insurance type list in Risk Analysis
3. **Customize AI prompts**: Update the AI_AGG prompts for different insights
4. **Adjust visualizations**: Modify chart types and data groupings

See `CLAIMS_DASHBOARD_GUIDE.md` for detailed customization instructions.

### Changing Analysis Prompts

Customize prompts in `streamlit_app.py`:
```python
prompts = {
    "Claims Trends": "Identify claims frequency, severity, and emerging patterns",
    "Coverage Gaps": "Identify potential coverage gaps and exposure areas",
    "Risk Patterns": "Analyze risk patterns specific to Marine insurance claims"
}
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

- All data processing happens within your Snowflake account
- No data leaves the Snowflake environment
- LLMs are fully managed by Snowflake
- Follows Snowflake's security and governance model
- Supports Snowflake's row-level security and masking policies

## üìä Cost Considerations

Cortex AISQL functions incur compute costs based on:
- Model used (larger models = higher cost)
- Number of input/output tokens
- Function complexity

**Track costs:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.METERING_HISTORY
WHERE SERVICE_TYPE = 'CORTEX'
ORDER BY START_TIME DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

**Cost optimization tips:**
- Use llama3.1-8b for simple tasks
- Use llama3.1-70b for complex analysis
- Batch process when possible
- Cache results for repeated queries
- Use AI_FILTER to reduce rows before expensive AI operations

## üß™ Testing

### Verify Database Setup
```sql
USE DATABASE CORTEX_AISQL_DEMO;
USE SCHEMA DEMO_DATA;

-- Check tables
SHOW TABLES;

-- Verify data counts
