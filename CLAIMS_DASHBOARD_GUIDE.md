## Technical Notes

### SQL Query Patterns

**Extract with multiple fields:**
```sql
SELECT 
    ticket_id,
    AI_EXTRACT(ticket_text, [['amount','What is the claim amount?']]):response.amount::string as claim_amount,
    AI_EXTRACT(ticket_text, [['type','What type of insurance?']]):response.type::string as insurance_type
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE category = 'Claims'
```

**Aggregate analysis by category:**
```sql
SELECT 
    AI_AGG(
        ticket_text,
        'Summarize the key issues in these claims'
    ) as analysis
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE category = 'Claims'
AND LOWER(ticket_text) LIKE '%cyber%'
```

**Sentiment distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
    AI_SENTIMENT(ticket_text):categories[0].sentiment::string as sentiment,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM customer_tickets
WHERE category = 'Claims'
GROUP BY sentiment
```
